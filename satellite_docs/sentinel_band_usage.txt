Using Sentinel Bands for Index Calculation and Visualization

1. Combining Bands to Create Normalized Indexes
------------------------------------------------
Certain remote sensing indexes are calculated by mathematically combining specific bands that are sensitive to particular land features.
Two common examples:

- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):
  Measures vegetation health and density using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Red bands.

  NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

  Bands used:
  - 'nir' (Band 8 – Near-Infrared, 10m)
  - 'red' (Band 4 – Red, 10m)

- NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index):
  Detects water bodies using Green and NIR bands.

  NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)

  Bands used:
  - 'green' (Band 3 – Green, 10m)
  - 'nir' (Band 8 – Near-Infrared, 10m)

Both indexes return values between -1 and 1, where higher NDVI indicates healthier vegetation and higher NDWI indicates more water content.
Such indexes are calculated with pairs of frequencies.

2. Stacking Bands for Visualization
------------------------------------
Bands can also be stacked (layered) to produce composite images, commonly for visualization or classification.

- True Color Composite (Natural RGB):
  Combines Red, Green, and Blue bands to simulate what the human eye would see.

  Bands used:
  - 'red' (Band 4 – Red, 10m)
  - 'green' (Band 3 – Green, 10m)
  - 'blue' (Band 2 – Blue, 10m)

  This RGB combination forms the basis for the 'visual' asset in Sentinel data, often used for quick inspection.

Other composites (like false color) use different combinations (e.g., NIR-Red-Green) to enhance vegetation or water detection.
